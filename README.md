## Overview
The goals are to refactor SQL to be on overall, reusable function, and clean up the existing functions to use SQL properly. After that we are adding Eventbrite, Yelp, and Movies API's. 

## Getting Started

## Architecture
Code refactored. Now we need to add new API's, figure out how to properly call them from documentation/postman. One by one, work each API until funtioning properly.
